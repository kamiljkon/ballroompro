A Ballroom Competition Platform for all the parties involved in the organization and the running of the event. Created as a CS32 final project by Kamil K.

**How to run:**
Run the "main.py" file and navigate the program by entering desired inputs.

**Projet component outline:**
The script consists of two major components: the competitor's interface and the organizer's interface.

The competitor's interface allows a user to:
- create and login into an account
- form partnerships with other users
- register to compete in competitions

The organizer's interface allows a user to:
- create and login into an account
- create a new competition and define which events will be held
- organize a competition by sorting competitors into heats
- run a competition and receive a detailed summary of the results
